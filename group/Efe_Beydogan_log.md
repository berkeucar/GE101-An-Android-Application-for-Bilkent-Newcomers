On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 26.04.2020 ~
I learned how to implement Google Maps in Android Studio and how to restrict the map to a certain location because in our app we aim to show the users only the Bilkent University vicinity.
### ~ 28.04.2020 ~
Added the introduction screen, sorted out asking permissions from the user for receiving location and implemented methods to lock on user location when the app is opened

Added search bar on top of the map

### ~ 29.04.2020 ~
Looked more at how to implement the map for our project
