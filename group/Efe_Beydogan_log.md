On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 26.04.2020 ~
I learned how to implement Google Maps in Android Studio and how to restrict the map to a certain location because in our app we aim to show the users only the Bilkent University vicinity.
### ~ 28.04.2020 ~
Added the introduction screen, sorted out asking permissions from the user for receiving location and implemented methods to lock on user location when the app is opened

Added search bar on top of the map

### ~ 29.04.2020 ~
Looked more at how to implement the map for our project

### ~ 01.05.2020 ~
Added main menu buttons

### ~ 02.05.2020 ~
We customized the search bar so it would autosuggest when something is searched. (It took us [mostly Arda] about 4-5 hrs.)

Added splash screen

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
Added tabs to bus schedule page

Added bus schedule button on the map

Fixed a minor bug that caused multiple pages to be opened when a button is clicked more than once

### ~ 05.05.2020 ~
Added custom markers

Improved the search bar so when a suggestion is clicked you are taken to that location

Changed the map style to a dark theme

### ~ 06.05.2020 ~
Looked at how to implement custom markers

### ~ 07.05.2020 ~
Figured out how to display custom markers that show information about specific buildings

### ~ 09.05.2020 ~
Added buildings to the map so they show up when searched

Added clear button to the AutoCompleteTextView so it is easier to delete what you've written on the search bar

### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
Looked at how to display customized building names on the map

### ~ 12.05.2020 ~
Added place names on the map

### ~ 13.05.2020 ~
Fixed the map being too laggy

Added listeners on labels so when clicked the marker with custom info window is displayed
