On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 24/04/2020 ~ 
Today we decided that who will work on what. I am in the same subgroup with Alper and we will work on GPS and QR Systems.

### ~ 26/04/2020 and 27/04/2020 ~ 
Today I have refresh my mind about GPS technology and started getting knowledge about AndroidStudio. I also studied on what location system should we use in order to get efficient location. I have tried to check how the GUI things work. I have setted up virtual devices and implemented a little tutorial myself.
