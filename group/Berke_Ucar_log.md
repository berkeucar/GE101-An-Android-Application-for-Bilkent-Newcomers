On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 04/04/2020 ~
Today I have studied on location providers, Location, LocationListener, LocationManager Classes and their methods, how to use etc.

### ~ 24/04/2020 ~ 
Today we decided that who will work on what. I am in the same subgroup with Alper and we will work on GPS and QR Systems.

### ~ 26/04/2020 and 27/04/2020 ~ 
Today I have refreshed my mind about GPS technology and started getting knowledge about AndroidStudio. I also studied on what location system should we use in order to get efficient location. I have tried to check how the GUI things work. I have setted up virtual devices and implemented a little tutorial myself.
 
### ~ 28/04/2020 ~
Today I have looked up to map settings and how to use maps in Android Studio. Actually it is not my subgroup's responsibility but since we will use techs coordinately we must know basic things about maps. 


### ~ 30/04/2020 ~
I checked about how to use QR in android studio.

### ~ 02/04/2020 ~
Today we discussed about AutoCompleteTextView with Arda, Efe and Barkın and added.

### ~ 04/04/2020 ~
The main menu of eating places is added. Furthermore the campus cafeteria's food menu added. A major bug is fixed with Efe, Arda and Mert.

### ~ 05/04/2020 ~
Tab of eating places added and east campus places designed.
Map changes and markers discussed with Efe and Arda.

### ~ 06/04/2020 ~
Custom map designed and added as a light theme. 
I got into the custom changes but, as far as I imagine, GoogleMaps does not provide that much details because of our location, Turkey. I will check if we have another choice.
