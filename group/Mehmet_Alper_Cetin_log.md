On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 24.04.2020 ~
Today we discussed what skills we need to learn, we disturbed the classes. I give a little bit info about QR codes as well.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week I helped by doing logs, changing personal logs.

### ~ 07.05.2020 ~
I look into QR code, how to create and use them. Found out that it is very diffucult to create a class by yourself for QR code. Although there is an open code in github called ZXing and one provided by google.

### ~ 09.05.2020 ~
Writing places for data to show on map.

### ~ 12.05.2020 ~
wrote the codes of achievements and added labels

### ~ 21.05.2020 ~
I kept on writing achievements package added some activities to show the achievements
and tried to make a code that is buildable. But I didn't manage the time well so
I couldn't write the code for Qr Scanning. I was planning on using  ZXing for the Qr Scan Activity
and I was planning to use free Qr Code writers on web. But although I didn't finish the code for
Qr Scan I think my Achievements package was understandable and buildable.
