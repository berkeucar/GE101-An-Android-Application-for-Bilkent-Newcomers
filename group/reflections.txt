Working on this project helped us learn about how to work as a group on coding projects, how
to distribute project load and implement an Android app for phones. While doing this project,
we also realized the importance of utilizing the internet for finding solutions to our 
problems and our researching capabilities have improved significantly. We realized how useful
GitHub is for coding projects, it helped us so much while doing our project. The most difficult
aspect of the project was the fact that we didn't know anything about writing apps for Android
and we had to learn everything from scratch and troubleshooting was very hard. If we were to start
again, we would start earlier so we would have more time to learn and implement the project. 
We would try to follow the MVC pattern better and make it more object oriented than it is right now.
The project was finished in about a month and we worked on it almost everyday for that duration.
On the days we worked on it, we spent over 2 hours coding. We are proud of the end product
because we have achieved a lot of the things we wanted to include in the app. We believe it could
have been better but we are still content with the way it turned out. There are a couple things we'd like
to have added but we couldn't because they were too complicated for us to implement.
